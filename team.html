            <h3>Claude Le Tohic</h3>
            <p>Chef Partner</p>
          </header>
          <div>
            <p>Claude Le Tohic, Chef Partner, and conceptual visionary of ONE65, brings extensive Michelin star experience to the San Francisco culinary scene.  ONE65 represents an exciting new chapter in Le Tohic’s decorated career, presenting four distinct, modern French dining experiences under one roof.  Le Tohic’s vision is to celebrate modern French cuisine without pretense, incorporating California’s fresh produce at its finest, and to offer a full range of menus -- from casual pastries and coffee to French-California fine dining -- for every taste, every hour, every occasion.</p>
            <p>Le Tohic’s culinary journey began with crêpes.  Born into a restaurant family in northern France, Le Tohic recognized at an early age that the culinary arts were his calling. He started waiting tables but was soon working side by side with his parents, learning all aspects of running the business. </p>
            <p>Le Tohic attended culinary school in Vannes, France.  Upon graduation, he accepted an apprenticeship at Les Hortensias, a one-Michelin star restaurant.  Two years later, he joined the kitchen of acclaimed Chef Ghislaine Arabians’ at Le Restaurant, a two-Michelin star eatery in Lille, France.  Recognized for his skills and creativity, less than a year later he became chef de cuisine, working alongside Joël Robuchon, at Jamin, a three-Michelin star restaurant in Paris.</p>
            <p>In 1998, Le Tohic stepped into a lead position at the Centre de Formation d’Apprentis Interconsulaire de l’Eure (CFAIE), a prestigious apprenticeship program.  In 2004, in the presence of the president of the French Republic, he received the highly revered, peer-juried “Meilleur Ouvrier de France” award for his efforts in preserving, advancing and perpetuating the tradition of French cuisine.  Le Tohic is the only active chef in the U.S. who has been honored with this prestigious award.  After seven years of inspiring work at the CFAIE, Le Tohic moved to the United States, where his creativity earned the restaurant Joël Robuchon at the MGM Grand the only three Michelin star rating in Las Vegas. </p>
            <p>Claude Le Tohic has garnered numerous awards in recognition his for skills, including the James Beard Foundation Award of Best Chefs in America 2010 and induction as a member of “Les Maîtres Cuisiniers de France” (Master Chefs of France).  Despite his distinguished credentials, Claude Le Tohic remains a grounded and humble professional, continually inspiring those around him and excited to share his talents with the world.</p>

            <h3>Pratik Mungre</h3>
            <p>Assistant Chef, ONE65</p>
          </header>
          <div>
            <p>Pratik Mungre brings his years of international experience in French and Italian cuisine to the role of Assistant Chef of ONE65. Pratik’s diverse career has seen him work with renowned chefs in all corners of the world. ONE65 represents an exciting next step in Mungre’s culinary career, in which he will be working closely with Executive Chef and Partner Claude Le Tohic to execute his vision of celebrating modern French cuisine without pretense, incorporating California’s fresh produce, and offering a full range of menus − from casual pastries and coffee to French-California fine dining − for every taste, every hour, every occasion. </p>
            <p>Growing up in India, Mungre’s career has seen him make many international moves, although he began his love affair with hospitality in his home country. Shortly after his graduation from studying Hospitality & Hotel Administration at the Institute of Hotel Management in Bhopal, Mungre made his first international move to the U.K. While studying towards a Post Graduate Diploma in Culinary Arts at the Ealing, Hammersmith and West London College, he immersed himself in the world of French cuisine. During his studies Mungre took up his first role as Demi Chef de Partie at Chef Joel Antunes’ Brasserie Joel in the Park Plaza Hotel at Westminster Bridge. Mungre’s time working under Chef Antunes continued as he moved to the exclusive Mayfair neighborhood to work at the Embassy Club as Chef de Partie where he stayed for a year before making his next career move.</p>
            <p>In November of 2012, Mungre moved to Singapore where he accepted the role of Chef de Tournant at the Spathe Public House in the city’s quiet River Valley district. Here, Mungre took on many rolels as he helped train his team, developed new dishes alongside the Sous Chef and Executive Chef and head up rotating stations. While working at Spathe Public House, Mungre developed his knowledge of how to run a kitchen, learn the intricacies of staffing, and manage the back of house.</p>
            <p>After a year and half in Singapore, Mungre moved to the U.S. to once again work with Joel Antunes as the Sous Chef at One Eleven in Arkansas’s Capital Hotel. While at One Eleven, Mungre played a larger role in the overall management of the kitchen working across multiple sections during service to ensure the highest standards from the team. Perfecting his attention to detail and efficiency in the kitchen was key to his success, and helped him develop a strong team environment with those that he trained and managed.</p>
            <p>In March 2017, Mungre made his next move, this time to Northern California where he joined the Alexander’s Steakhouse team in Cupertino as Sous Chef. While working at the renowned Cupertino restaurant, Mungre was introduced to Chef Claude Le Tohic and began to form a relationship with him that would eventually see him take the role of Assistant Chef at Le Tohic’s ONE65.</p>

            <h3>Francesco Di Marzio </h3>
            <p>Chef de Cuisine,</p>
            <i>O’ by Claude Le Tohic</i>
          </header>
          <div>
            <p>Francesco Di Marzio brings an enviable wealth of experience in Michelin Star restaurants to the role of Chef de Cuisine at O’ by Claude Le Tohic, the fine dining concept within ONE65. Di Marzio’s impressive career has seen him work with some of the worlds most respected chefs in renowned restaurants around the world. ONE65 represents an exciting next step in Di Marzio’s culinary journey, in which he will be working closely with Executive Chef and Partner Claude Le Tohic to present an exquisite fine dining experience in the heart of San Francisco. </p>
            <p>Di Marzio’s storied career has seen him make many international moves, although he started his path with humble beginnings in Italy, starting in as a line cook in Tivoli, just outside of Rome. Following this, Di Marzio spent his summers and weekends working in a collection of restaurants and hotels developing his understanding of the kitchen, and creating the foundations of his extensive knowledge of flavors.</p>
            <p>In 2009 Di Marzio had his first role in a Michelin Star restaurant, when he began as Demi Chef at Open Colonna under Chef Antonello Colonna in Rome’s city center. Di Marzio worked under Chef Colonna for just under a year before being promoted to Chef de Partie, where his responsibilities expanded and he began to flourish in the Michelin kitchen environment.</p>
            <p>Di Marzio moved to London, England in late 2012 and began working at The Greenhouse, another Michelin starred institution in the heart of London’s exclusive Mayfair neighborhood. While at The Greenhouse Di Marzio was in charge of the meat section, and alongside his team and Head Chef Arnaud Bignon achieved a second Michelin star while in the role. The Greenhouse was where Di Marzio honed his skills crafting stunningly balanced, beautifully plated dishes that received critical acclaim.</p>
            <p>A few years later Di Marzio took the role of Chef de Partie at Amber at the Landmark Mandarin Oriental in 2014, a two Michelin-starred contemporary French fine dining restaurant in Hong Kong. Di Marzio worked under Executive Chef Richard Ekkebus, as the lead of the seafood section, training his staff and organizing daily produce orders. A year after moving to Hong Kong, Di Marzio moved to San Francisco where he began at the renowned three Michelin-starred Benu, as Chef de Partie under Chef Corey Lee. Benu represented a new challenge for Di Marzio, mastering new techniques and how to apply them to new ingredients he had not worked with before.</p>
            <p>After expanding his culinary horizons at Benu, Di Marzio was given the opportunity to return to The Greenhouse in London this time as Executive Sous Chef in 2016. A role which saw him take the reins of the two-star kitchen, managing the teams to ensure the utmost perfection of each dish. As Executive Sous Chef, Di Marzio was in charge of menu development, creating inspired new combinations, and researching new techniques to produce both complex and visually stunning menu items.</p>
            <p>Now returning once again to San Francisco, to join Executive Chef and Partner Claude Le Tohic at O’, Di Marzio brings with him an abundance of technical skill, an inspired palate and a truly creative brain.</p>

As a member of the Wahta Mohawks First Nations, Dewasha developed a deep passion for food through community focused events and celebrations, leading her to attend the Aboriginal Cuisine Program at George Brown College where she developed her techniques and broadened her culinary repertoire.</p>
            <p>Upon graduation and in search of opportunities to explore the world of fine dining, Dewasha located to Las Vegas where she began working with Chef Daniel Boulud at DB Brasserie, in the Wynn Hotel. She continued to build her career thereafter by joining L’Atelier de Joel Robuchon, then finally onto the three Michelin-starred Joel Robuchon in the MGM Grand Hotel where she met ONE65 Executive Chef and Partner Claude Le Tohic who was Chef de Cuisine at the time.</p>
            <p>Ready to return to Canada, Dewasha took the opportunity to open the Ritz Carlton Toronto and shortly thereafter rejoined Daniel Boulud as a crucial player in opening Café Boulud at the Four Seasons Hotel Toronto. In 2016, Dewasha moved on to take the role of Executive Chef of Colette Grand Café with Chase Hospitality Group with her passion for local agriculture, sustainable products and traditional preparations, which was heavily reflected in the menu she created.</p>
            <p>Starting her career in the kitchen in entremetier positions due to a male-dominant environment caused Dewasha to love and appreciate the intricacy and importance of vegetables. She has therefore been inspired through her culinary journey to highlight any and all ingredients, especially using vegetables to highlight main dishes using simple and traditional techniques. Dewasha’s extensive flavor profile, precise techniques and appreciation of locally sourced ingredients will add to ONE65’s unique culinary experience.</p>

          <div>
            <p>Olivier de Roany, General Manager of ONE65, brings exceptional food and beverage management expertise with a mix of entrepreneurial spirit to the experienced team at ONE65. It also brings de Roany back to San Francisco, where he spent the early part of his career honing his skills at the iconic Westin St. Francis.</p>
            <p>A native of Paris, France, de Roany started the bulk of his career in San Francisco where he worked for the Westin St. Francis in a variety of positions in food and beverage, gaining extensive and well-rounded experience over the course of four years. Like ONE65, the Westin St. Francis is located in San Francisco’s Union Square, a popular destination for both locals and visitors alike. He managed the front and back of house and earned accolades from Westin for implementing the best-selling specialty beverage program in the West Region.</p>
            <p>Building on his success, de Roany took a position as Assistant General Manager at Adour Restaurant & St. Regis Bar, an Alain Ducasse restaurant in Washington D.C. The renowned restaurant within the St. Regis Hotel was a favorite of politicians, lobbyists and business people and earned the AAA Four-Diamond Award. De Roany was responsible for all facets of the restaurant and bar, including managing staff, overseeing special events and private parties, as well as overseeing all operations.</p>
            <p>De Roany then followed Ducasse to Las Vegas where he took a job as an Assistant General Manager at miX Restaurant & Lounge, which then became Rivea & Skyfall Lounge two years later, located in the Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino. He managed the front of house staff ensuring that Ducasse’s vision was carried out through every aspect of the operation.</p>
            <p>Following this, de Roany moved onto become general manager at L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon at the MGM Grand Hotel & Casino where he met and worked alongside ONE65’s Executive Chef and Partner, Claude Le Tohic, who was chef de cuisine at the time, and the Robuchon team. He oversaw Robuchon’s unique concept where each meal is prepared in front of the guests and assisted with the menu design and engineering to deliver Vegas’ top culinary experience.</p>
            <p>While in Las Vegas, de Roany launched two businesses of his own in the hospitality industry, a collection of beauty studios offering a menu of upscale services, and a hospitality solutions company that provides cutting-edge tools for increasing revenue streams and improving customer service restaurants, bars and hotels.</p>
            <p>With his return to San Francisco, de Roany joins with Claude Le Tohic to launch an entirely new vision that brings four distinct modern French culinary concepts under one roof.</p>

            <h3>Trevin Hutchins</h3>
            <p>Beverage Director</p>
          </header>
          <div>
            <p>Trevin Hutchins brings his creative and exuberant energy to the role of Beverage Director at ONE65. Hutchins’ extensive hospitality experience has seen him as the driving force in some of the country’s most inventive creative cocktail programing. ONE65 represents an exciting next step in Hutchins’ varied career, in which he will be working closely with Executive Chef and Partner Claude Le Tohic and Wine Director Vincent Morrow to present four distinct, modern French dining experiences under one roof. Hutchins will be a key figure in the development of each floor’s beverage and cocktail program. </p>
            <p>Hutchins’ journey into the cocktail scene began with his time in Las Vegas at The Cosmopolitan’s French bistro Comme Ca, where he worked under Sam Ross, notably of Milk & Honey in New York, a famed institution and one of the city’s best-loved bars before it closed in 2013. While at Comme Ca, Hutchins perfected the foundations of classic cocktails with rigid teaching from Ross on the art of balance of creating inventive drinks.</p>
            <p>Following his time in Las Vegas, Hutchins made his way to the East Coast, where he began his residency as Bar Manager for two of Maine’s top restaurants simultaneously. At Natalie’s, the renowned fine dining restaurant housed in the Camden Harbour Inn, Hutchins perfected a contemporary classic cocktail menu which focused on culinary pairing. While at Tempo Dulu, a Southeast Asian fine dining destination in the historic Danforth Inn, Portland, Hutchins’ dynamic beverage program utilized modernist techniques to create complex flavor profiles and visually stunning presentations. His beverage creations at the sister properties saw critical acclaim, garnering national press attention from the likes of the New York Times, Bon Appétit and Vogue. </p>
            <p>In his short time on the East Coast, Hutchins established himself as one of the most innovative mixologists not just in Portland, but in the country, soon winning Starchef’s Cocktail of the Year in 2015, alongside an invitation to design cocktails for the Golden State of Cocktail convention in Los Angeles. His approach to cocktail formulation employs wildly creative thinking, using an enormous variety of ingredients and techniques, mixing drinks that provide stimulation for all the senses</p>
            <p>Now embracing the West Coast for the first time, Hutchins will play an integral role in supporting Chef Le Tohic’s vision of celebrating modern French cuisine, while showcasing his captivating talent through the dining destination’s extensive beverage program. </p>

            <h3>Vincent Morrow</h3>
            <p>Wine Director</p>
          </header>
          <div>
            <p>Vincent Morrow, Advanced Sommelier, WSET 3, brings a wealth of Michelin-star experience to the San Francisco culinary scene. ONE65 represents an exciting next step in Morrow’s stellar career, working closely with Executive Chef and Partner Claude Le Tohic to present four distinct, modern French dining experiences under one roof. Morrow is a key figure in the development of each floor’s wine program, directly engaging with suppliers from Bordeaux to California to curate a collection of the finest wines at every price point. He will play an integral role in supporting Chef Le Tohic’s vision celebrating modern French cuisine without pretense, incorporating California’s fresh ingredients, and offering a full range of menus -- from casual pastries and coffee to French-California fine dining -- for every taste, every hour, every occasion</p>
            <p>Morrow’s journey into the fine-dining scene originated when he came to California to attend Sonoma State University, from which he earned a BA in Business Administration, Wine Business Strategies, and Marketing. His love for wine and hospitality has always been grounded in his search for knowledge, and sharing that knowledge with guests and peers alike.</p>
            <p>Morrow has journeyed through some of Northern California’s finest wine and culinary destinations. His first breakthrough started as a Hospitality Associate at Ridge Vineyards, where he educated guests about one of California’s most iconic wineries. This led to his next role at Round Pond Estate, where he worked as a Harvest Intern and Wine Educator. This eventually led  to his role as Beverage Director and Assistant General Manager at 1313 Main Wine Bar & Lounge in downtown Napa, firmly solidifying his expertise in the operations of running, and managing an extensive wine program.</p>
            <p>In 2013, Morrow began his first of numerous fine dining positions within Thomas Keller’s prestigious restaurant, The French Laundry, where he started as a food-runner. Over the following two years he worked his way through the ranks to become the restaurant’s Cellar Sommelier, working closely with Master Sommelier Dennis Kelly in service and to receive, organize, and maintain the restaurant’s inimitable cellar. </p>
            <p>In 2015, Morrow took his first floor sommelier position at San Francisco’s renowned restaurant, Gary Danko, where he mastered a list of nearly 3,000 worldwide selections with an emphasis on California and France. During his time there, Morrow became the 2016 USA Champion in the TopSOMM Young Sommelier Competition, the first of numerous accolades in his career. Shortly after, Morrow began working with Master Sommelier Yoon Ha to execute daily wine duties at the three-Michelin starred Benu, and assisting Ha with new wine list acquisitions, continually developing beverage pairings in accordance with menu changes, while also leading monthly training seminars for all front of house and back of house staff, covering beverage and food pairing through specific wine regions and styles.</p>
            <p>In March of 2017, Morrow decided to further pursue education, sharing the knowledge that he had amassed during his time at Northern California’s top Michelin-starred restaurants and took the position of Education Director at GuildSomm. Morrow devised and maintained the educational content for a membership of 13,000 wine professionals, attending and teaching at classes for members throughout the U.S.</p>
            <p>While working concurrently at GuildSomm, Gary Danko and Benu, Morrow entered the 2017 Chaîne des Rôtisseurs Jeunes Sommeliers Competition, winning the USA Championship and placing 3rd overall in the world.</p>
